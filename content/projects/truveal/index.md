## Company Intro:

Truveal is a concept that I have wanted to built. I believe there is a lack of trust by consumers about online reviews: both with regards to companies creating or purchase fake reviews and with regards to review sites having a conflict of interest as their customers are the companies being reviewed. Finally, there is a unintended situation were people write poor reviews as a alternative to contacting customer support in order to get a faster & better resoluation to their problems.

My solution incorporates a point based system to ensure an online identity is old enough before being able to review companies. It also is free for companies to use and so avoids any potential conflict of interest.  Additionally, trust is a strong foundation of the platform and all reviews are kept (although potentially not used to score) unless there is a legal requirement to delete them. Monitization is via a mediation system for poor reviews, which in effect acts as a tool to allow customer support requests to be actioned prior to a poor review being published. 

## Project Details:

Truveal is a side project, however, I created the concept, current brand, and MVP. Future work is need to allow websites to display & gather reviews on their site as well as creating the mediation monitization aspect of the site. I've also done a pitch deck and sent to a couple of accelators, however, have decided to run personally in the background as a small side project.

## Team Composition & My Role:

My role was as sole Founder. I've created everything by myself.
