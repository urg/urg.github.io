## Company Intro:

[CSN Energy](https://www.csnenergy.com/en/) offers a SAAS whitelabel solution to French Energy Suppliers.

## Project Details:

I was hired to investigate and potentially implementent the expansion of the French product into the UK market. I worked closely with the UK product owner to understand the UK Market and architect a technical solution. I created a working website demo of the solution we planned on offering and together with the senior UK team, did several product demostrations to UK energy suppliers.

## Team Composition & My Role:

I was hired as the CTO for the UK company and worked closely with the UK MD and the UK product owner. I hired 2 developers to work on the project, however, they started towards the end of my time there and so did the majority of the work on the product myself.
